title: Interactive fractal path tracer
excerpt: "With one other team member, I built a CUDA-accelerated path tracer with a free floating camera. The path
          tracer renders noisy, but recognizable, scenes with primitive shapes and fractals (using the marching rays
          algorithm) within milliseconds. For simple scenes, it can converge to a noise-free image within seconds, but
          with difficult lighting conditions it can take minutes."
