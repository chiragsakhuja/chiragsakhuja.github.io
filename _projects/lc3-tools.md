title: Creating an LC-3 assembler and instruction-level simulator [in progress]
excerpt: "I worked with three team members to design a ARM-based CPU from the ground up and develop a successful form
          of value prediction. We first deisgned an in-order, pipelined implementation but then moved to an HPS-style
          out-of-order implementation. After modeling the architecture in SystemC, we implemented the design in
          structural Verilog with unit- and top-level SystemVerilog testbenches. To aid us with verification and
          demoes, we also built a wide array of tooling."

ARM with Datapath eXtensions (ADX), is a CPU design project I undertook with three others under the supervision of Dr.
Yale Patt for my senior capstone at UT. Our initial goal was open ended: pick an ISA, design a CPU, and then make it
better. What we ended up developing was an ARMv4 out-of-order CPU with a successful form of value prediction and a less
successful configurable coprocessor.

### Proteus: Starting simple

### Hydra: Going out-of-order

### Makara: Adding the eXtensions

### Kraken: From SystemC to Verilog

### Ares: The special sauce
