title: Autonomous robot car 
excerpt: "Our team of four built an autonomous car that navigates a maze with obstacles and other cars. The car ran on
          a real-time operating system of our own making that managed two microcontrollers, several sensors, and a set
          of motors. Our car also won a class-wide race.
