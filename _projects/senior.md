title: ARM CPU with value prediction
excerpt: "I worked with three team members to build an ARM-based CPU from the ground up and develop a successful form
          of value prediction."

When I was a senior in high school, I debated whether to apply for Electrical Engineering (Electrical and Computer
Engineering at some schools) or Computer Science. I never ended up making a decision. For those that are less keen on
double majoring though, I hope that I can shed some light on the differences. Disclaimer: my comments are in the context
of UT and may not transfer to departments at other universities.

## Content
Broadly speaking, ECE involves the theory and applications of analog and digital circuits. There are two specializations
of EE at UT: Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering. Each can be further broken down into technical
cores; EE includes communications and signal processing, energy systems, and integrated circuits; CE includes computer
architecture, embedded systems, and software engineering. Computer Science's closest sibling in the ECE department
is software engineering, the most popular technical core. In CS, the emphasis is placed on learning a breadth of
languages through projects and other practical means. Software engineering focuses more on design paradigms that help
keep programs maintainable. I didn't take any of the software engineering classes since my interests were in computer
architecture. Some of the undergraduate classes I've found most useful are Introduction to Computing (EE 306), Computer
Architecture (EE 460N), Real Time Operating Systems (EE 445M), Verilog Design (EE 460M), and Algorithms (EE 360C). In
these classes, I found everything I needed to prepare me for industry work in computer architecture.

Computer science is much more widely understood than EE (I've had more encounters than I'd like to admit with people
who ask me why I need a Master's degree to change a light bulb, but I digress...). In its purest form, computer science
studies the theory behind algorithms and software. Practically, anything written in some programming language falls
under computer science. CS is an umbrella as wide as EE is, but the CS department at UT doesn't try to group classes
together into cores like EE does. Instead, the CS curriculum gives you flexibility to learn through a variety of
project-driven classes. The undergraduate classes I personally enjoyed most were Operating Systems (CS 439), Compilers
(CS 375), Automata Theory (CS 341), Computer Graphics (CS 384), and Programming for Performance (CS 378).

## Teaching Style
In my opinion, teaching style should be a first class citizen when deciding what major or class to pick. If the teaching
style does not match your way of learning, then you'll be less motivated to go to classes and you'll start off at a
disadvantage.

EE classes at UT are rigorous. The first two EE classes in the curriculum, Introduction to Computing and Introduction to
Electrical Engineering, are both difficult, but give a sense of what future classes will be like. It's important to
understand that if you are struggling with the introductory classes, it's indicative that you may struggle in the later
classes. A general theme through the EE department is to lecture on the fundamentals and then have the students
understand the concepts through projects, problem sets, and exams. Projects focus on practical applications of the
material, whereas exams extend class discussions. EE classes take a departure from the high school grading norm and
assign grades by class average, which typically hovers around 60.

The CS program has a starkly different environment. Professors spend time spoon-feeding all the details of the material
and the exams mostly ensure the students were awake during lecture. The bulk of the CS workload comes from projects. In
the upper division classes especially, the assignments prepare the students for a final project of their choice, which
takes several weeks to complete. In my experience, despite having less diverse work than EE classes, CS classes take up
a significant amount of time.

## Logistics
This section wouldn't exist in an ideal world, but alas. The EE department at UT has had a hard cap of 1500 students for
over 9 years now, so class sizes are similar between semesters and availability of classes isn't a significant concern.
Due to its wildly increased popularity, the CS department has had an influx of students and is struggling to hire enough
professors to meet the demand. Furthermore, the EE and CS departments have developed an enmity for each other, since
many EE students were "double majoring" with CS to take the interesting classes, only to drop the CS degree before
graduating. Registration is tight, and double majoring is nigh impossible now. It has been getting better, but it's
still a noteworthy problem.
