title: LC-3 assembler and simulator
excerpt: "I creating an LC-3 assembler and simulator to revamp the existing set of tools available to students
          using the Introduction to Computing textbook by Dr. Yale Patt and Dr. Sanjay Patel. The tools run across all
          major platforms and decouple the backend from the Electron and command line frontends. I specifically designed
          the tools to cater to students as much as the graders."
