For the last 13 semesters, I've had the privilege of being a teaching assistant or a lecturer for several classes. My
foray into teaching began as a tutor in the ECE department. Shortly after, I transitioned into being a TA for Computer
Architecture (EE 460N), Introduction to Computing (EE 306), and Introduction to Software Development (EE 312). I also
created and lectured the Introduction to Linux and Introduction to Python (EE 107S) classes somewhere in the mix.

## Learning confidence
I was thrown off guard when I received a call asking if I wanted to be a TA for Computer Architecture. I was sitting at
my desk with 2 other interns at Centaur Technology at the time. The call was shocking because I had recently been
declined a TA position for Introduction to Computing with Dr. Yale Patt. The call was shocking because Computer
Architecture was well known as being one of the hardest classes in the department to be taken primarily by upper
classmen and graduate students. Apparently a rejected rising junior was qualified to help teach it.

My first two years at UT were completed with relative reticence. I went to classes, did my work, took my exams, and
didn't leave any marks. I did well in my classes, but I retreated in my shell for the most part. 

## Learning socializing
It's not uncommon for a TA to learn all the students' names through discussion sections and office hours. The more
routine students often divulge their personal life. In some cases, those students carry on as friends in future
semesters.

I've met some of my closest friends by being their TA. The conversations are, unsurprisingly, forced at first. However,
it turns out students and TAs (and professors) are human.

Despite interacting with literal generations of ECE students in my time as a TA, I'm still not used to being introduced
as "Yeah, *that* Chirag!".

## Learning teaching
First-time TAs often ask me if I have any quick tips. The one I usually pick: follow your words as they come out of
your mouth. What mental leaps did you have to make to transition between sentences? Could the student follow the leaps?

I recently had a lengthy conversation with Dr. Nina Telang, a professor teaching, among other things, a class on how to
enhance academic success in the ECE program. We decided that the main role of the professor is to ensure the students
are receiving up to date and factual material and the main role of the TA is to ensure the students are performing up to
their potential. There are a plethora of external "academic" factors - undue stress from overlapping deadlines, lack of
passion for the material in a mandatory class, 

## Learning learning
Dr. Yale Patt, Dr. Aater Suleman, and Dr. Derek Chiou, in descending order by count, are the professors I've listened to
for a full semester of Computer Architecture (a grand total of 6 times). This last semester, Fall 2018, I listened
to Dr. Yale Patt's lecture. The material hasn't changed at all, but my experience and perspective has. 

## Learning impact
The greatest feeling in the world is when a student thanks you for getting them through a class or internship. You know
that you played only a minor role in their success, but it's clearly a role that had impact.

It doesn't really take much effort to explain how to debug a student's specific program, but it's effort that the
student will remember. It doesn't really take much effort to show your own passion and excitement toward the material,
but it manifests in the students' own enthusiasm for the class and field. It doesn't really take much effort to give
back a couple of points in a dispute (or, hopefully, have any real impact on their letter grade), but it gives the
student a more positive outlook on their performance.

It doesn't really take much effort to be a TA that contributes to the student's academic success. It does, however, take
legitimate concern for each student as an individual.
