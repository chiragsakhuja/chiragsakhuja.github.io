<div class="home">
  Welcome to my home page! I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu">The University of Texas</a> working
  under <a href=https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lin/">Calvin Lin</a>. My background is in computer architecture, although
  my research seems to be heading in the direction of systems - specifically toward hardware-software cooperation.

  I have a (woefully empty) <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a> in which I (plan to) catalog interesting things I
  encounter and a list of some <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> I have worked on. I'm also a hobbyist
  photographer and occasionally post <a href="{{ site.url }}/photography">pictures</a>. <br> <br>

  <div class="recent-posts">
      <h4>Recent Blog Posts</h4>
        {% for post in site.posts limit:5 %}
        <div>
          {{ post.date | date: "%b %-d, %Y" }} &nbsp; <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
        </div>
        {% endfor %}
