  Welcome to my home page! I'm a (fairly new) GPU Architect at NVIDIA, where I get to play around with the performance
  of future generations of GPUs. I joined NVIDIA after graduating with an M.S. in Computer Architecture from The
  University of Texas. I also completed my undergraduate education at UT in Electrical and Computer Engineering and
  Computer Science in 2015. Hook 'em! <br> <br>

  If you want to do some reading, head over to my <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog">blog</a>, where I catalog a few
  interesting things and a bunch of mundane things. I also like to hack at
  <a href="{{ site.url }}/projects">projects</a> and am a <a href="{{ site.url }}/photography">hobbyist photographer</a>
  in my free time. <br> <br>
